# <Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard>

## Description
In this project I built a weather dashboard that operates within a web browser. The dashboard will utilize third-party APIs to access weather data and dynamically update HTML and CSS to display this information in a user-friendly manner.

In this section you can search for any city and click the search button in order to get the 5 day weather forecast for that particular City.

In this part you have a list of recent locations that you searched for which is saved in the local storage so whatever City you searched will come underneath there and as it is saved you can click on it anytime and it will still come up again.

Here it shows the the current and future forecase weather so you can see the current weather of that city followed by the next 5 days.
